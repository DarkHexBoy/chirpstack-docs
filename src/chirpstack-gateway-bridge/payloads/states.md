# States

States are generated by the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge and forwarded to the configured
integration as retained messages. Depending the `marshaler` configuration, these
are sent as:

* JSON: JSON based on the Protobuf Buffers JSON mapping (for debugging)
* Protobuf: Protocol Buffers binary encoding (recommended)

For the [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)
message definitions, please refer to [gw.proto](https://github.com/chirpstack/chirpstack/blob/master/api/proto/gw/gw.proto).

## State types

### `conn` - Gateway connection state

JSON example:

```json

	"gatewayId": "0016c001f153a14c",
