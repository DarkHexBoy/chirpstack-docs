# Configuration

## Web-interface

ChirpStack Gateway OS can be configured using the provided web-interface.
To access the web-interface, enter `http://GATEWAY-IP-ADDRESS/` in your
browser. For example if the IP address of your gateway is `192.168.0.1`,
then you need to enter `http://192.168.0.1`.

The default credentials are:

* Username: `root`
* Password: _(not set)_

## SSH

It is also possible to configure the ChirpStack Gateway OS using a CLI
over SSH. Use the following command to SSH into the gateway:

```
ssh root@GATEWAY-IP-ADDRESS
```

ChirpStack Gateway OS uses the OpenWrt [UCI system](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci) for handling configuration.

To show the current ChirpStack configurations:

```bash
uci show chirpstack-concentratord
uci show chirpstack-mqtt-forwarder
uci show chirpstack-udp-forwarder

# Only for Full images
uci show chirpstack
```

Please refer to the [UCI system](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/uci)
guide for information about using the UCI configuration system. After modifying
ChirpStack configuration and a `uci commit`, the updated services will be
automatically restarted.
