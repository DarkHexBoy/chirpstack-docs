# Node-RED

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) provides a browser-based flow editor that makes
it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette.

If you have installed the **Full** image, then Node-RED is pre-installed,
including the [node-red-contrib-chirpstack](https://github.com/brocaar/node-red-contrib-chirpstack/)
package which provides several nodes to interact with ChirpStack.

Node-RED can be opened from the web-interface, by clicking **Applications**
in the left menu, and then clicking the **Node-RED** icon.
