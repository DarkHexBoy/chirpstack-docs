## v4.0.0

This marks the initial release of the ChirpStack MQTT Forwarder.

The ChirpStack MQTT Forwarder is a re-implementation of the ChirpStack Gateway
Bridge for gateway installations only. The aim of this component is to provide
a more lightweight solution, that also can be installed on gateways with a
limited amount of memory (for example Dragino OpenWRT based gateways).
