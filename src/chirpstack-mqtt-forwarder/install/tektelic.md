## Kona gateways

These instructions appy to the Linux based Tektelic Kona gateways.

* [Product detail page](https://www.tektelic.com/products/gateways/)

### SSH into the gateway

The first step is to login into the gateway using ssh:

```bash
ssh root@GATEWAY-IP-ADDRESS
```

The default password is the serial-number of the gateway which is printed on
the back of the gateway (the 9 characters above the 12V = 1A line).

### Packet-forwarder configuration

You must configure the packet-forwarder on the gateway to forward its data
to `127.0.0.1` at port `1700`. The file `/etc/default/config.json` must
contain the following lines:

```json
    ...
    "gateway_conf" {
        ...
        "server_address": "127.0.0.1",
	    "serv_port_up": 1700,
	    "serv_port_down": 1700,
	    ...
    }
	...
```

After updating the configuration file, make sure to restart the packet-forwarder:

```bash
/etc/init.d/pkt_fwd restart
```
