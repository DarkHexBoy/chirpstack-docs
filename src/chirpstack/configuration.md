# Configuration

To list all CLI options, start `chirpstack` with the `--help` flag. This will
print:

```text
ChirpStack is an open-source LoRaWAN(TM) Network Server

Usage: chirpstack --config <DIR> [COMMAND]

Commands:
  configfile
          Print the configuration template
  print-ds
          Print the device-session for debugging
  import-legacy-lorawan-devices-repository
          Import legacy lorawan-devices repository
  create-api-key
          Create global API key
  help
          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -c, --config <DIR>  Path to configuration directory
  -h, --help          Print help
  -V, --version       Print version
```

## Configuration files

ChirpStack must be started using the `-c` / `--config-dir` argument. This
directory must contain one or multiple `.toml` configuration files. Typically
it will contain a single `chirpstack.toml` configuration file for common
configuration, and multiple `region_...toml` configuration files, one for
each region configuration.

## Environment variables

Values in the configuration file can be substituted by environment variables.
Example:

```toml
[integration.mqtt]
  server="tcp://$MQTT_BROKER_HOST:1883/"
  json=true
```

In the above example, `$MQTT_BROKER_HOST` gets replaced if the `MQTT_BROKER_HOST`
variable is set, with the value of this environment variable.

## Configuration examples

Configuration examples are included in most ChirpStack distributables. A
complete overview of configuration examples can be found here:

### Example `chirpstack.toml` configuration

```toml
{%raw%}
{{#include chirpstack.toml}}
{%endraw%}
```

### Example `region_eu868.toml` configuration

```toml
