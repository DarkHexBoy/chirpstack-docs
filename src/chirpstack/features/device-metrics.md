# Device metrics

ChirpStack is able to visualize collected device metrics in simple graphs
for the purpose of testing and proof of concepts. In order to start visualizing
measurements, you must configure the following. Once configured, ChirpStack
will aggregate the configured measurements per hour for the last 24 hours, per
day for the last 31 days and per month for the last year.

This feature can be configured within the [Device profiles](../use/device-profiles.md)
by configuring a **CODEC** and one or multiple **Measurements**.
