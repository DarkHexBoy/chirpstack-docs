# Join server

ChirpStack supports the activation of devices through an
external Join Server, using the API as specified in the LoRaWAN Backend
Interfaces specification. In this case the session-keys will not be derived by
ChirpStack and there is no need to configure the `AppKey` (and `NwkKey` in case
of a LoRaWAN 1.1 device).

Routing a join-request to a Join Server is based on the `JoinEUI` which is part
of the LoRaWAN join-request. If ChirpStack finds a server matching
the `JoinEUI`, then it will forward the join-request to this server. In any other
case, ChirpStack will handle the join-request.

## Configuration

### Semtech LoRa Cloud Join Server

To configure the Semtech LoRa Cloud Join Server with ChirpStack obtain the TLS
certificates that you must use from the LoRa Cloud web-interface.

* Under **Your network servers** click **Add Server**
* Then click download credentials

Within the obtained credentials archive you will find three files that you need
to configure within the ChirpStack configuration:

* `.trust`: must be configured as `ca_cert`
* `.crt`: must be configured as `tls_cert`
* `.key`: must be configured as `tls_key`

**Note:** While the web-interface indicates that `https://js.loracloud.com:7009`
is the **LoRa Cloud Join Server**, this is not the endpoint that must be
configured as `server` within the ChirpStack configuration. The
correct endpoint is `https://js.loracloud.com:7009/api/v1/rens/rens-XYZ/lbi`.
You have to replace `rens-XYZ` with the actual Rens ID, you will find this value
in the LoRa Cloud web-interface.


Example configuration:

```toml
[[join_server.servers]]
join_eui="0016c001fffe0001"
server="https://js.loracloud.com:7009/api/v1/rens/rens-123/lbi"
ca_cert="/etc/chirpstack-network-server/certs/acct.trust"
tls_cert="/etc/chirpstack-network-server/certs/acct.crt"
tls_key="/etc/chirpstack-network-server/certs/acct.key"
```
