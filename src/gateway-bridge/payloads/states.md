# States

States are generated by the ChirpStack Gateway Bridge and forwarded to the configured
integration as retained messages. Depending the `marshaler` configuration, these
are sent as JSON or [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/). For the Protobuf
definitions, please refer to [gw.proto](https://github.com/brocaar/chirpstack-api/blob/master/protobuf/gw/gw.proto).

* The Protocol Buffers [JSON Mapping](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#json)
  defines that bytes must be encoded as base64 strings. This also affects the `gatewayID` field.
  When re-encoding this filed to HEX encoding, you will find the expected gateway ID string.

## `conn` - Gateway connection

Gateway connection state.

### JSON

```json
{
    "gatewayID": "cnb/AC4GLBg=",
    "state": "ONLINE"
}
```

### Protobuf

This message is defined by the `ConnState` Protobuf message.
