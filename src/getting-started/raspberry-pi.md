# Quickstart Raspberry Pi

For getting started with a Raspberry Pi based LoRa gateway, ChirpStack
provides the ChirpStack Gateway OS. This OS is an [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/)
based image which comes in two flavors:

* **Base:** Everything that is required to turn your Raspberry Pi into a
  LoRa gateway, which forwards its data to an external ChirpStack instance.
* **Full:** This image includes the ChirpStack Network Server to use the
  Raspberry Pi both as gateway and as LoRaWAN Network Server.

Please refer to the [ChirpStack Gateway OS documentation](../chirpstack-gateway-os/index.md)
for installation and usage instructions.
