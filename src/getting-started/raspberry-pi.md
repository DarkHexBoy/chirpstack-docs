# Quickstart Raspberry Pi

For getting started with a Raspberry Pi based LoRa gateway, ChirpStack
provides the ChirpStack Gateway OS. This OS is a [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)
based image which comes in two flavors:

* **Base:** Everything that is required to turn your Raspberry Pi into a
  LoRa gateway, which forwards its data to an external ChirpStack instance.
* **Full:** This image includes the full ChirpStack stack to use the Raspberry
  Pi both as gateway and as LoRaWAN Network Server.

## Flashing
